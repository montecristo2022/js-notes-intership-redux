This application can be used to create, edit, delete, archive and unarchive notes.
This application implements the functionality for counting the number of notes by category and all dates in the note specified in the format 3/3/2023 or 3/3/2023 are pulled into a separate column with the dates that are mentioned in the note.
I used react-redux, typescript, tailwind to implement this app.
